# wheatboard
This is a custom-made devboard featuring a RP2040, I/O headers, a USB-C power supply, flash storage, crystal oscillator, and LEDs as indicators. This project was made to enhance my PCB skills, learn to use KiCad better, and qualify for Prototype, which I hope to attend. 

## Schematic 
Here is the schematic for the devboard. I tried to make it neat and organized, with labels for all major components of the devboard. Below is a screenshot:

## PCB
Here is the PCB for the devboard. The routing for the devboard took forever, since this was my first PCB project which lots of traces. I tried to organize all the components in a tight and effective manner. Below is a screenshot:

## BOM
I got the BOM from PLCPCB. One includes the parts, and the other includes the final cost.
